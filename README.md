# Projects-VU
Here are some of my projects at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
<br />
- Realized GARCH.ipynb is from a casestudy in the masters, where I estimated realized garch models. The realized GARCH models incorporate intra day prices to estimate/predict volatility. Furthermore we did some out-of-sample-performance and some backtesting.
- In TSM_assign2.py is from the course Time Series Models, We estimated the local level model and used an algorithm  to estimate the mode of the model.
- CCC&DCC_GARCH_Normal.ipynb, BEKK.ipynb, CCC&DCC_GARCH_Student-t.ipynb, Dataset.ipynb are python scripts for my thesis. I estimate multivariate GARCH models and I want to investigate the correlation between the DAX and CAC40 stock indices. Furthermore I want to see how well they perform out of sample to conclude which model is the best for prediction.

I am currently working on my thesis and not everything is finished yet. In the upcoming months, I will update my code regularly.
