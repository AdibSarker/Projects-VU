# Projects-VU
A taste of my projects at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
<br />
- Realized GARCH.ipynb is from a case study in the masters program Financial Econometrics, where I estimated Realized GARCH models under numerous error distributions. The realized GARCH models incorporate intra day prices in order to estimate/predict volatility. Furthermore, I initiated and performed out-of-sample performance tests and backtests.
- TSM_assign2.py is from the course Time Series Models, again from the masters program, where State Space Models (SSM) have been estimated and Kalman Filters have been applied in order to estimate the unobserved states from the SSM.
- CCC&DCC_GARCH_Normal.ipynb, BEKK.ipynb, CCC&DCC_GARCH_Student-t.ipynb and Dataset.ipynb are from my masters thesis. Multivariate GARCH models have been estimated, with the purpose of investigating the correlation between the DAX and CAC40 market indices. Furthermore, the out-of-sample performance has been analysed in order to conclude which model under which error distribtution entails the most accurate predictive ability. 
- CopulaNormal.ipynb, CopulaStudent.ipynb and CopulaSkewed-t.ipynb are from my master thesis. Copula models have been estimated, with the purpose of investigating correlation beween the DAX and CAC40.  Furthermore, the out-of-sample performance will be analysed in order to conclude which model under which error distribtution is able to explain the depence structure of the time series.

Update: My masters thesis is currently work in progress. In the upcoming months, I will update my code regularly.
